                <p>   My real name is Joseph but you can call me "Goose". For I am your "wingman" for your programming technologies. My career starts as a junior database administrator. I was assigned to create complex queries using Microsoft SQL and reporting through a web based application. I became a technology junkie where I learned and produced a Windows application that imports XML files to our database. I was also responsible of creating a web based application to our clients where they can see our in-house activities.</p>
                <p>As I move on in my career, I became an Integration Engineer for Sweetlabs. I sharpen my skills of coding specifically with assembly and installers. I also produced a web based client server application. As of now my goal is to improve my skills and learn new emerging technologies.</p>
